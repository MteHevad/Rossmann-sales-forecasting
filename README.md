#Project README
#Overview
This project focuses on exploring customer purchasing behavior and predicting store sales using machine learning and deep learning techniques. It involves three tasks: data exploration, sales prediction, and model serving via an API.

#Task 1: Exploration of Customer Purchasing Behavior
Goal: Analyze customer behavior by exploring how promotions, holidays, store openings, and other factors affect sales.

#Steps:
1. Data Cleaning:
- Handle missing values and outliers to ensure accurate analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Investigate the distribution of promotions in training vs. test sets.
- Compare sales behavior before, during, and after holidays.
- Identify seasonal trends (e.g., Christmas, Easter).
- Analyze the correlation between sales and customer numbers.
- Assess promo effectiveness and customer behavior during store openings/closings.
3. Visualization:
- Use plots (e.g., histograms, heatmaps) to communicate findings.
4. Logging:
- Log each step using Pythonâ€™s logger for reproducibility.
Task 2: Prediction of Store Sales
Goal: Predict store sales for six weeks ahead using machine learning and deep learning models.

#Steps:
1.Preprocessing:
- Convert categorical features to numeric, handle NaNs, and generate new features (e.g., days before/after holidays). Scale data using StandardScaler.
2. Model Building:
- Use tree-based models like Random Forest in sklearn pipelines for modularity.
3. Loss Function:
- Choose and justify a loss function (e.g., MAE, RMSE).
4. Post-Prediction Analysis:
- Analyze feature importance and estimate confidence intervals.
5. Model Serialization:
- Save models with timestamps (e.g., model-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS.pkl).
6. Deep Learning:
- Build an LSTM model for time series sales prediction using TensorFlow or PyTorch.
Task 3: Model Serving API Call
Goal: Create a REST API to serve the trained models for real-time predictions.

#Steps:
1. Framework Selection:
- Use Flask, FastAPI, or Django REST to build the API.
2. Load Model:
- Load the serialized model from Task 2.
3. API Endpoints:
- Create endpoints to receive input data and return predictions.
4. Request Handling:
- Preprocess input data and make predictions.
5. Deployment:
- Deploy the API to a cloud platform for real-time use.
